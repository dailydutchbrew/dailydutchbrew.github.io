This is a site to track my progress and experiments for sports betting.

<i>Note (Podcast recordings before Dec 22, 2020):</i>

Before I started a more flat level betting, I started with all parlay bets on
MLB. From a stretch of August 11 to September 10, I recorded podcast episodes
with daily MLB parlay bets. My record from those episodes is as follows:

<b>Record:</b> 27-57-5

<b>Total units betted</b>: 23.56

<b>Net Units:</b> +7.31

I finished this parlay season with a positive bankroll despite a
losing record. The reason being that most 2 game parlays gay out an average of
2.5 / 1 odds, and I was also able to hit 3, 4, and 5 game parlays a few times
over the course of the month.

I have had multiple occasions where I hit 5/6 games correct, and barely came out
profitable due to the style of parlay bets. I will seek a way to incoporate a
flat betting style with a sprinkle of parlays for risk managable winnings.
