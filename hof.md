<h1>2021</h1>
<h2>Steph Curry</h2>
<p>
  Sadly Curry's season has come to an end. However he will be mentioned and
  nominated for 2021 Hall of Fame. What he did for the Warriors was unreal. He
  was a staple for the 3 point prop, and over on points. Also in both play-in
  games, Curry finished with 37 and 39 pts, which won the over by 0.5 points in
  both occassions.

<p>
  I had a win total set for the Golden State Warriors at over 37.5. They
  finished the season with 39 wins. They went on a 16-6 run down the stretch
  <strong>heavily</strong> relying on Steph. He is the reason the Warriors got
  into the play-in games, and why the Warriors had a season above 500. I did
  put in a small wager for Steph to win MVP, at insane odds. <strong>IF</strong>
  Steph, somehow, wins the MVP (probably not, Jokic is like stapled to win). I
  think Steph would automatically win as my 2021 Betting MVP. Which Steph
  (and planet Earth), 100% DGAF about. LOL
